Got this panda plush toy for my daughter's birthday, \
who loves it and takes it everywhere. It's soft and \ 
super cute, and its face has a friendly look. It's \ 
a bit small for what I paid though. I think there \ 
might be other options that are bigger for the \ 
same price. It arrived a day earlier than expected, \ 
so I got to play with it myself before I gave it \ 
to her.
